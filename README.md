Before Sunrise
"I believe if there's any kind of God it's not in us, 
not in you and me, but just in that little space in between.
If there's any kind of magic in this world, 
it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something."

Pride & Prejudice
"You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you."

'''
Flipped 
"Some of us get dipped in flat,
some in satin, some in gloss... 
But every once in a while, 
you find someone who's iridescent, 
and when you do, nothing will ever compare."

Carol
"Just when I think I've figured you out, 
you go and you do something that makes me feel like I have no idea who you are.
And then I want to know more about you than I did before."

Portrait of a Lady on Fire
"Do you know when a painting is finished?"
"It's not. I don't know."
"When one of us leaves the room, the other can go. It's not finished."

Disobedience
"I spent my life fighting to be the person I was, 
to be myself. 
And all I really wanted was for someone else to see me, to know me.
For them to see the me that no one else can."
